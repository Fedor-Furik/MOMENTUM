            <p id="p1">It s very laughable poem about shadow</p>
            <p id="p2">I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,</p>
            <p id="p3">And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.</p>
            <p id="p4">He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;</p>
            <p id="p5"> And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.</p>
                
            <p id="p6">The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to growâ€”</p>
            <p id="p7"> Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;</p>
            <p id="p8">For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,</p>
            <p id="p9">And he sometimes gets so little that there s none of him at all.</p>
